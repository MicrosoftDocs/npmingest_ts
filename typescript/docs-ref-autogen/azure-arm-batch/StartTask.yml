      In some cases the start task may be re-run even though the node was not
      rebooted.

      Due to this, start tasks should be idempotent and exit gracefully if the
      setup they're

      performing has already been done. Special care should be taken to avoid
      start tasks which create

      breakaway process or install/launch services from the start task working
      directory, as this will

      block Batch from being able to re-run the start task.

      The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
      this

      value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
      try the task once,

      and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
      count is 3, Batch tries

      the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
      retry count is 0, the

      Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1,
      the Batch service

      retries the task without limit.

      If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
      retries the

      start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task
      has still not

      completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
      compute node

      unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
      detected via the node state

      and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for
      the start task to

      complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
      node while the start

      task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
      continue to be

      scheduled on the node. The default is true.
