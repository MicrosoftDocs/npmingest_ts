      The maximum percent of total virtual machine instances that will be
      upgraded simultaneously by

      the rolling upgrade in one batch. As this is a maximum, unhealthy
      instances in previous or

      future batches can cause the percentage of instances in a batch to
      decrease to ensure higher

      reliability. The default value for this parameter is 20%.

      The maximum percentage of the total virtual machine instances in the scale
      set that can be

      simultaneously unhealthy, either as a result of being upgraded, or by
      being found in an

      unhealthy state by the virtual machine health checks before the rolling
      upgrade aborts. This

      constraint will be checked prior to starting any batch. The default value
      for this parameter

      is 20%.

      this percentage is

      ever exceeded, the rolling update aborts. The default value for this
